# Aura.Framework_Project

This package provides a minimal framework for combined web and command-line projects.

By "minimal" we mean *very* minimal. The package provides only a dependency
injection container, a configuration system, a web router and dispatcher, a CLI dispatcher, a pair of web request and response objects, a pair of CLI context and standard I/O objects, and a logging instance.

This minimal implementation should not be taken as "restrictive". The DI
container, with its two-stage configuration system, allows a wide range of
programmatic service definitions. The router and dispatchers are built with
iterative refactoring in mind, so you can start with micro-framework-like
closures, and work your way into more complex controller and command objects of
your own design.

## Foreword

### Requirements

This project requires PHP 5.4 or later; we recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle.

Unlike Aura library packages, this project package has userland dependencies, which themselves may have other dependencies:

- [aura/cli-kernel](https://packagist.org/packages/aura/cli-kernel)
- [aura/web-kernel](https://packagist.org/packages/aura/web-kernel)
- [monolog/monolog](https://packagist.org/packages/monolog/monolog)

### Installation

Install this project via Composer to a `{$PROJECT_PATH}` of your choosing:

    composer create-project aura/framework-project {$PROJECT_PATH}

This will create the project skeleton and install all of the necessary packages.

### Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/settermjd/simple-auraframework-project.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/settermjd/simple-auraframework-project)

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `./phpunit.sh` at the package root. This requires [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/) to be available as `phpunit`.

Alternatively, after you have installed the project, try the "hello world" CLI and web apps.

For the CLI, go to the project directory and issue the following command:

    cd {$PROJECT_PATH}
    php cli/console.php hello

You should see the output `Hello World!`. Try passing a name after `hello` to
see `Hello name!`.

For the web, start the built-in PHP server with the `web/` directory as the document root:

    cd {$PROJECT_PATH}
    php -S localhost:8000 -t web/

When you browse to <http://localhost:8000> you should see "Hello World!" as the output. Terminate the built-in server process thereafter. (Be sure to use the built-in PHP server only for testing, never for production.)
