## About

This project, based off of the [Aura.Framework_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web_Project#getting-started), is a simple, example application designed in part to learn how the framework and [Aura](http://www.auraphp.com) work, and also to form the basis for a series of posts for the Conetix blog. In the project, you'll find a series of things, from working with Aura to integrating it with a number of services, including [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com).

As the project grows, assuming it does, you'll find more information here regarding what it's doing, who it's working with, and links to those respective projects.
